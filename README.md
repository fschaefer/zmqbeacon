zmqbeacon
=========
Usage speaks more or less for itself:

    zmqbeacon 0.1 - LAN service announcement and discovery

      Usage for LAN service announcement:
      zmqbeacon -a announcement [-i interval]
        -i : beaconing interval in ms (default: 1000)
        -a : announcement to send;
             Instead of -a, the announcement can be set
             via environment variable ZMQBEACON_DATA.

      Usage for LAN service discovery:
      zmqbeacon -l [-t timeout] [-s filter] [-r repeat] [-c command]
        -l : listen for beacons to arrive
        -t : wait for at most ms (default: -1 = forever)
        -s : subscribe to messages; no filter gets everything
        -r : repeat listening to beacons (default: 1)
        -c : execute shell command if a message is received;
             Received data is stored in environment variables
             ZMQBEACON_IP and ZMQBEACON_DATA.

      Additional options for both modes:
      zmqbeacon ... [-p port] [-v]
        -p : UDP port (default: 5670)
        -v : verbose output to stderr
